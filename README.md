# smart-compact

A Claude Code plugin that compacts context when you switch to a new task, not when you hit the context limit.

## How it works

1. You send a prompt. A `UserPromptSubmit` hook checks whether there's enough context since the last compaction (default about 20k tokens). If so, Haiku decides whether the prompt is a new task or a continuation.
2. For a new task, the hook saves your prompt, blocks it, and types `/compact Keep only what helps with the next task: <focus>` into your Terminal tab.
3. After compaction, a `SessionStart` hook (matcher `compact`) injects your saved prompt and types `Start the pending task.` Claude then does your task with clean context.

Any error fails open: your prompt goes through as normal.

## Install

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add 59nn5kmzy8-maker/smart-compact
claude plugin install smart-compact@smart-compact
```

To try it without installing, run `claude --plugin-dir ~/smart-compact`.

## Controls

- `new: <prompt>`: force compaction.
- `same: <prompt>`: skip it.
- `SMART_COMPACT_MIN_TOKENS`: the size threshold.
- `SMART_COMPACT_OFF=1`: turn the plugin off.

## Known limits

- Auto-typing only works in Apple Terminal, through AppleScript `do script` aimed at your tab's tty. It doesn't focus or raise the window. In other terminals the block message asks you to run `/compact` and then type `go`. The task is still restored.
- macOS asks once for permission to let the hook control Terminal. Allow it in that dialog.
- Each judged prompt adds about 5s, because `claude -p` starts a new process.
- The transcript's `compact_boundary` marker isn't documented. If it changes, the whole transcript counts toward the size check, so the judge just runs more often.

## Measured: 10 A/B scenarios

Each scenario ran twice, without and with the plugin, starting from the same seeded context. The two runs used separate seeds, so the second couldn't benefit from the first's prompt cache. The context in the seed was the real token count from the API.

| # | Context | Model | Turns | Without | With (incl. judge) | Saved | Time diff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 57k | Opus | 1 | $1.76 | $2.14 | -22% | +16s |
| 2 | 57k | Opus | 5 | $1.63 | $1.37 | 16% | +12s |
| 3 | 176k | Opus | 1 | $3.07 | $2.47 | 20% | +22s |
| 4 | 176k | Opus | 5 | $4.22 | $3.12 | 26% | -15s |
| 5 | 290k | Opus | 3 | $5.59 | $4.29 | 23% | -4s |
| 6 | 290k | Opus | 6 | $6.77 | $4.69 | 31% | +34s |
| 7 | 176k | Opus | 2, related task | $3.21 | $3.23 | 0% (judge kept the context, correctly) | +6s |
| 8 | 176k | Opus | 2, half-related | $3.29 | $2.73 | 17% | +22s |
| 9 | 176k | Sonnet | 3 | $2.07 | $2.00 | 4% | +26s |
| 10 | 176k | Opus | 3 different tasks | $3.47 | $2.69 | 22% | +12s |

Total: $35.08 without, $28.72 with, so the plugin saved 18%. Tests passed in every run that had tests. The judge cost $0.005–0.013 per run.

- The more context there is and the more turns follow, the bigger the saving. A small context followed by a single turn loses money.
- Compaction adds 10–74s, but later turns are faster, so long tasks often finish sooner.
- Related follow-ups are not compacted. The only cost of the plugin there is the judge.
- With `--fork-session`, the first prompt is never judged, because the new transcript is still empty at that point.

## Test

```sh
node --test
```
